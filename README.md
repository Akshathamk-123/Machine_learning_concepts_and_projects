# Machine_learning_concepts_and_projects

From What I have heard, the whole learning happens in the journey and not only on reaching a goal.

Therefore,I have gone through a set of step by step process while studying Machine Learning, and this is the process I went through while learning it.


I have written down all the algorithms I have learnt 
and there are most of the ML projects that I have done 

I have stored all the templates also for further use in future ML projects that I am gonna take up
