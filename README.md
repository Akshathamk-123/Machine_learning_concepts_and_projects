# Machine_learning_concepts_and_projects

From What I have heard, the whole learning happens in the journey and not only on reaching a goal 
Therefore, here is a way I have learnt Machine Learning, and this is step by step process I went through while learning Machine Learning 

I have written down all the algorithms I have learnt 
And there are most of the ML projects that I have done 

I have stored all the templates also for further use in future ML projects that I am gonna take up
